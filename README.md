# Shot Perfect
> An open-source alternative to CleanShot X for macOS. Capture, edit, and enhance your screenshots with professional quality.

Shot Perfect is a fast, lightweight screenshot tool built with Tauri + React. It provides a powerful yet simple workflow for capturing screenshots, editing them with backgrounds/effects/annotations, and exporting quickly.

## Background

Clean screenshot workflows usually need three things: capture fast, polish fast (background/shadow/roundness), and annotate fast (arrows, labels). Shot Perfect is a macOS-native app that keeps everything local and lightweight.

## Features

### Capture Modes

- **Region capture**: Select any area of your screen (`⌘⇧2`, enabled by default)
- **Fullscreen capture**: Capture your entire screen (`⌘⇧F`, enable in Preferences)
- **Window capture**: Capture a specific window (`⌘⇧D`, enable in Preferences)

### Image Editing

- **Background library**: Curated wallpapers, Mac assets, and mesh patterns
- **Custom backgrounds**: Solid colors and transparent checkerboard
- **Effects**: Blur + noise controls
- **Shadow + roundness**: Tune depth and corner radius
- **Export**: Save at high quality for docs, decks, and social

### Annotation Tools

- **Shapes**: Circle, rectangle, line, arrow
- **Text**: Add text with adjustable size
- **Numbered labels**: Auto-incrementing badges for step-by-step callouts
- **Editability**: Select, move, and delete annotations
- **Styling**: Colors, opacity, borders, alignment

### OCR (Optical Character Recognition)

- **Text extraction**: Extract text from screenshots using OCR
- **Full image processing**: Recognizes text from the entire edited image including annotations
- **Copy to clipboard**: Easily copy extracted text for use elsewhere
- **Automatic preprocessing**: Image enhancement (grayscale, contrast, brightness) for better accuracy
- **Auto-rotation**: Automatically detects and corrects rotated text
- **Offline support**: OCR works fully offline with bundled Tesseract.js and language data

### Workflow

- **Global shortcuts**: Capture from anywhere, even when hidden
- **Auto-apply**: Apply default background and save without opening the editor
- **Clipboard**: Copy to clipboard after capture/export
- **Preferences**: Save directory, defaults, and shortcut settings persist
- **Menu bar**: Accessible from the menu bar
- **Native performance**: Rust + Tauri

5. Grant Screen Recording permission when prompted

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vikasexcel/ShotPerfect.git
cd ShotPerfect

pnpm install

pnpm tauri build
```

The installer will be located in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`

#### Requirements

- **Node.js**: 18+
- **pnpm**
- **Rust**: latest stable

#### Required permissions

On first launch, macOS will request **Screen Recording** permission:

1. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording**
2. Enable **Shot Perfect**
3. Restart the application if needed

This permission is required for the app to capture screenshots of your screen.

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. Launch Shot Perfect from Applications (or use the menu bar icon)
2. Capture:
   - Default: `⌘⇧2` (region)
   - Optional (enable in Preferences): `⌘⇧F` (fullscreen), `⌘⇧D` (window)
3. Edit (background/effects/shadow/roundness)
4. Annotate (shapes, arrows, text, numbered labels)
5. Extract text: Use the "Extract Text" button to run OCR on your screenshot
6. Export: `⌘S` to save, `⇧⌘C` to copy to clipboard

### Auto-apply workflow

For faster workflows, enable **Auto-apply background** on the main screen:

1. Toggle on "Auto-apply background" on the main page
2. Set your preferred default background in Preferences
3. Capture a screenshot - it will automatically apply the background and save instantly
4. No editor needed - perfect for quick captures with consistent styling

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Capture shortcuts are customizable in Preferences.

#### Capture Shortcuts

| Action | Default Shortcut |
| --- | --- |
| Capture Region | `⌘⇧2` |
| Capture Fullscreen | `⌘⇧F` (disabled by default) |
| Capture Window | `⌘⇧D` (disabled by default) |
| Cancel Selection | `Esc` |

#### Editor Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
| --- | --- |
| Save Image | `⌘S` |
| Copy to Clipboard | `⇧⌘C` |
| Undo | `⌘Z` |
| Redo | `⇧⌘Z` |
| Delete Annotation | `Delete` or `Backspace` |
| Close Editor | `Esc` |

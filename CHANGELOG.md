## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Background Border at 0px**: Fixed issue where background was still visible when Background Border was set to 0px. Now 0px means no background border at all - the screenshot edges touch the canvas edges directly.

### Added

- **Background Border slider**: New control in the Background Effects panel to adjust the padding around captured screenshots
  - Slider range: 0px (no border) to 200px (maximum border)
  - Smart default: Automatically calculates 5% of the average image dimension, capped at 200px
  - Real-time preview updates during slider drag
  - Full undo/redo support
  - Tooltip explaining the control's purpose
- **Frontend test framework**: Set up Vitest with React Testing Library
  - 19 tests for editor store padding functionality
  - Test coverage for transient/commit actions, undo/redo, and smart defaults
- **Rust unit tests**: Added tests for image processing utilities
  - 8 tests for CropRegion bounds clamping and validation
  - 5 tests for filename generation and directory utilities

### Changed

- Padding is now a configurable setting stored in EditorSettings (previously hardcoded to 100px)
